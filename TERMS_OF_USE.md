### Terms of Use: VAPA Framework and Materials

(Last updated: December 2025)

This document outlines the terms of use for the Virtual Autonomous Prompt Assistant (VAPA) framework, including its CORE logic, DATA references, SLOT system, and any associated documentation or materials (collectively referred to as “the Materials”).

These Materials are created by Christopher Bennetts and published by Digital Freedom Alliance (DFA). The official home of these Materials is https://github.com/TheVirtualWebmaster/vapa

The Materials are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) License. This choice reflects VAPA's core philosophy: to empower users with control and portability over their AI interactions, fostering a community-driven ecosystem that prioritizes user sovereignty over commercial exploitation.

#### 1. What You CAN Do with These Materials

You are free to:

*   **Use and Distribute:** Utilize and share the Materials for **non-commercial purposes**, including in personal projects, community initiatives, educational settings, and non-profit endeavors.
*   **Share As-Is:** Distribute the original Materials (e.g., VAPA CORE, DATA, or SLOT files) without modification.
*   **Adapt and Remix:** Modify, translate, or build upon the Materials to create your own VAPA-compatible components (e.g., custom SLOT files, new DATA mappings, or enhanced CORE logic).
*   **Integrate:** Incorporate VAPA's principles and architecture into your own non-commercial tools or systems.
*   **Reference:** Apply VAPA concepts and methodologies in your work, provided proper credit is given (see Section 3).

#### 2. Modification Rules & ShareAlike Principle

The **ShareAlike** condition of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license is crucial for VAPA's ecosystem, ensuring that all adaptations contribute back to the commons.

*   **All Adaptations Must Be ShareAlike:** If you modify, translate, or build upon the VAPA Materials, you **must** distribute your contributions under the **same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license**. This ensures that VAPA remains a freely accessible and evolving resource for the community.
*   **Attribution Required:** Any modified or adapted Materials must clearly credit the original creator and DFA (see Section 3).
*   **Indicate Changes:** You must clearly indicate if changes were made to the original Materials.

#### 3. Attribution Requirements

Any use, distribution, or adaptation of the VAPA Materials must include the following attribution:

“This work incorporates concepts and materials from the Virtual Autonomous Prompt Assistant (VAPA) framework by Christopher Bennetts for Digital Freedom Alliance, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. Original materials available at https://github.com/TheVirtualWebmaster/vapa.

You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which you share the Materials.

#### 4. Prohibited Uses

🚫 **No Commercial Use of VAPA Core:** You cannot use the VAPA Framework's CORE, DATA, or System Files, or any direct adaptations of these core components, for primarily commercial advantage or monetary compensation without obtaining separate permission from Digital Freedom Alliance. (Refer to Section 5 for details on commercializing user-created content).

🚫 **No Rebranding:** You cannot rename or pass off the VAPA Materials or any significant derivatives as your own original work without proper attribution.

🚫 **No More Restrictive Licensing:** You cannot place these Materials or any adaptations under a more restrictive license than CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

🚫 **No False Claims:** You cannot imply that Digital Freedom Alliance endorses your additional content or claims to have created the VAPA framework.

#### 5. Commercialization of User-Created Content (SLOT Files, etc.)

While the VAPA Framework and its core Materials (CORE, DATA, and System Files) are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and are not to be used for commercial purposes, we actively encourage and support users in creating and commercializing their own unique content built *on top of* VAPA.

Specifically:

*   **User-Created SLOT Files and User Files (e.g., ALTER-EGO, ASSISTANT, CUSTOM, PROJECT, USER DATA files):** These files, when created by you and primarily containing your original content, are **not considered "Adapted Material" of the VAPA Framework for the purpose of the NonCommercial clause.**
*   **Your Right to Commercialize:** You are free to license, sell, or otherwise commercialize your own user-created SLOT files and other user files, and any services or products derived directly from them, under terms of your choosing.
*   **Attribution Still Required:** Even when commercializing your own creations, you must still provide proper attribution to the VAPA Framework as outlined in Section 3, acknowledging its role as the underlying platform.
*   **No Commercialization of VAPA Core:** This exception applies only to your original user-created content. You may not commercialize the VAPA CORE, DATA, or System Files themselves, nor may you commercialize any direct adaptations of these core components.

This distinction is intended to foster innovation and allow VAPA users to build sustainable projects and businesses using the framework, without compromising VAPA's foundational non-commercial ethos.
